    <h2>Pasta: The Staple of Italian Cuisine</h2>
    <p>
        Pesto pasta is a popular Italian dish made with fresh basil, garlic, Parmesan cheese, pine nuts, and olive oil. The ingredients are blended together to create a green, flavorful sauce that coats the pasta. This combination brings a fresh, herbal taste with a hint of nuttiness, which makes it a favorite for many.</p>
