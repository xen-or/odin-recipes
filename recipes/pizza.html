    <h2>Pepperoni Pizza:The Most Influential Italian Dish</h2>
    <p>Pepperoni pizza is a classic favorite, known for its spicy, flavorful pepperoni slices on a cheesy, tomato-based crust. The combination of melted cheese, tangy tomato sauce, and slightly crispy pepperoni creates a rich taste that many enjoy. This pizza is often baked until the pepperoni edges curl and become crispy, adding texture.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>½ (12 ounce) can Tomato Paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano, crushed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil, crushed</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>3 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 (.25 ounce) fast rise yeast</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups very warm water (120 degrees F to 130 degrees F)</li>
        <li>⅓ cup oil</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) packaged Pepperoni</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Step-by-Step Process:</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease two 12-inch pizza pans.</li>
        <li>Make sauce: Whisk together water, tomato paste, oregano, basil, garlic powder, onion powder, sugar, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until smooth. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Make crust: Combine 2 cups flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Add warm water and oil; mix until well blended, about 1 minute. Gradually add remaining flour, a little at a time, until a soft, sticky dough forms.</li>
        <li>Transfer dough to a floured surface; knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes. Add more flour as needed. (If using RapidRise yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)</li>
        <li>Divide dough in half. Lightly flour your hands, then pat each piece of dough onto the prepared pizza pans.</li>
        <li>Top dough with sauce, cheese, and pepperoni.</li>
        <li>Take an overhead shot of the unbaked pepperoni pizza on a pizza pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly, 18 to 20 minutes. Rotate pizza pans between the top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking.</li>
      </ol>
