# odin-recipes

Hi to whoever is reading this hope you have a good day. So this is my first time doing something related to web dev but so far html was smooth hopefully javascript,css,react,node and backend languages will go smoothly too

Anyways I will be making the use of bold,italiscs,paragraphs,headings,images to make a step by step guide on how to develop a website for biriyani,pizza and pasta recipes since those are my favourites
